## Description
Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.

To play you'll need 2 to 10 players, one 6-sided dice, and a pencil and some paper for keeping score.

Skull dice (where the 1 is replaced with a skull) work well for this game.
